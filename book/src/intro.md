> **ðŸ“– DATO: Distributed Approximate Timekeeping Oracle**

## Introduction and Motivation

Blockchain systems require consensus in order to agree on a shared view of the world.

In the case of ~turing-complete smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, this shared
view must essentially boil down to the exact state commitment of every newly produced
block, which is the only way for all validators to deterministically sync all the way
from genesis to the chain tip.

Other applications, such as simple payments, don't require full state machine replication:
all they need to achieve is to prevent equivocation (double spending). In this case, a
consensus-less approach may be used. [ABC][abc] and [Fastpay][fastpay] are good examples
of this construction.

In this document, we introduce DATO, a consensus-less approach to timekeeping that can
be used in a variety of applications to achieve one of the following benefits:

1. **Fair exchange accountability** for applications like [PBS][pbs] and [TEE-Boost][tee-boost]
2. **Censorship-resistant message feeds** for e.g. single-sequencer protocols like rollups

### High-level Design

DATO is a protocol that allows a group of validators to agree on the approximate time
when a message was seen. This is achieved by sending a message $M$ to some validators
$R$, getting each of their individual timestamps until a quorum of 2/3 is reached, and
then calculating the _median_ of all the timestamps to achieve the _certified timestamp_.

Each validator will sign over the message and the timestamp with their BLS private key,
and clients can then aggregate these signatures into 1 quorum certificate. This certificate
can then be verified by anyone / any chain (assuming PKI).

- Linear communication complexity: $n \times (m + r)$ ($m$ = message size, $r$ = response size)
- Minimal, constant latency
- Maximal throughput
